👋 **Welcome to "Hello_GenAI"!** Together, over five engaging days, we'll gently explore the exciting world of Generative AI, building our understanding comfortably and step-by-step. Here's what we'll experience and learn:

## 📖 Day 1: Getting Familiar with Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering
**What we'll explore:**
We'll start gently by understanding foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs)—such as Transformers—learning about their fine-tuning, performance optimization, and reasoning capabilities.

**What we'll learn:**
By the end of the day, we'll know how these powerful models function and master the art of prompt engineering—how to clearly communicate and interact with AI.
